# Menu-Driven Calculator

This is a simple Java program that implements a basic calculator with the following operations:

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Exit

## How it works

The program presents the user with a menu of operations and prompts them to select one. After choosing an operation (except for "Exit"), the user is asked to input two numbers. The program then performs the selected operation on the input numbers and displays the result. The process repeats until the user chooses to exit the program.

### Features:
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Handles division by zero by displaying a warning message.
- Uses a `do-while` loop to repeatedly prompt for operations until the user decides to exit.
